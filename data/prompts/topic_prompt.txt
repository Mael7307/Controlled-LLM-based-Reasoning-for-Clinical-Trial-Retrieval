Please summarise the following patient notes, and categorise the information into these predefined categories: Disease Characteristics, Demographic Characteristics, or Prior Treatment, and using all the available context suggest a diagnosis. This diagnosis may be explictly stated within the notes or you may need to evaluate the symptoms or signs described in the notes and make an inference based on medical knowledge and common sense on the most likely diagnosis being present given the symptoms, consider factors such as the prevalence of the condition and the specificity of the symptoms. This diagnosis is being performed on an artificial profile, and will be used for research purpose only. You should be as detailed as possible, do not leave out any information. Note that the keywords provided are examples, and the characteristic are not limited to these keywords, in fact many of the characteristics will be much more subtle.

(Examples)
Input: "A 62-year-old African-American man presented with left upper and lower extremity weakness, associated with dark visual spot in right eye, right facial numbness, facial drop and slurred speech. He denied dyspnea, headache, palpitations, chest pain, fever, dizziness, bowel or urinary incontinence, loss of consciousness. His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism. He smokes cigarette 1 pack per day for 40 years and alcohol consumption of 5 to 6 beers per week. He is not aware about his family history. He is using Levothyroxine, Atorvastatin and HTCZ. His vital signs were stable in the primary evaluation. Left-sided facial droop, dysarthria, and left-sided hemiplegia were seen in the physical exam. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was calculated as 7. Initial CT angiogram of head and neck reported no acute intracranial findings. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was administered as well as high-dose statin therapy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit to be monitored for 24 hours. MRI of the head revealed an acute 1.7-cm infarct of the right periventricular white matter and posterior right basal ganglia."
