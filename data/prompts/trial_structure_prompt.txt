Given a set of criteria, please tag the following clinical trial eligibility criterion with predefined categories: Disease Criteria, Demographic Criteria, or Prior Treatment Criteria. Use the following output format: {"Criterion": (String) criterion, "Categories": (list) Category names}. Do not change the wording of the criterion, and do not use any category other than Disease Criteria, Demographic Criteria, or Prior Treatment Criteria, do not return anything other than the output format. If appropriate you can tag a criterion with several categories. Note that the keywords provided are examples, and the criteria are not limited to these keywords.
